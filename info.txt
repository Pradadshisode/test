GitHub is a web-based platform that provides version control for software development projects. It offers a hosting service for Git repositories and various collaboration features for developers and teams. Here's some key information about GitHub:
Version Control: GitHub is built on top of Git, a distributed version control system. It allows developers to track changes to their codebase, collaborate with others, and manage different versions of their projects.
Repository Hosting: GitHub provides a hosting service for Git repositories. Developers can create repositories to store their code and related files. These repositories can be either public (accessible to everyone) or private (accessible to authorized collaborators only).
